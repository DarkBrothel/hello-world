# hello-world
Hi ladies and gentlement. This is my repository
 I was a front-end developer 6 years ago, during work i learn so many things but it makes me not focus and forget what i learn fast. I ever become network engineer, translator, lecture assistant, and the last project has made me as game developer using C# those experiences make me hard to develop myself and Now i want my skills back, such as UI/UX design and front-end coding. Those codes i have to learn are html 5, bootstrap, less CSS, javascript DOM, node.js, and angular. 
 Thanks
